# Chess

The basic groundwork for a console chess game

This is the code I'm using for a programming class I'm teaching. The objective is to teach about classes, objects, inheritence, etc.

## Next steps for students

This is code works but many parts of chess aren't supported. Students should understand this code and then improve/add to it.

Possible improvements:
* Detect checkmate
* Track and enforce the next player to move
* Detect and track pieces being eatten; display it to the user on demand.
* Make it so pieces can "see" the board to support:
  * Pawns making it to the other end
  * Castling
  * Preventing illigal hopping over your own pieces (where applicable)
 * Add fun easter eggs like the cheat code that already exists
 * Add support for a web based interface (requires supporting persistence or the introduction of javascript)
